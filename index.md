## Introduction
Hi!

I am Bart Lodder and I am a neuroscience Graduate student at the lab of Bernardo Sabatini at Harvard Medical school. 

To me, one of the most exciting things about neuroscience is its seamlessly endless complexity and it's relevance to our human experience. As a scientific community we have pushed the boundaries of what we know about the brain far, but at the same time it feels like we are just getting started. To solve this complexity, we need fine tools to understand the brain at every level (behavior, systems, cellular and molecular level) and only by integrating these levels are we able to gain a full picture of how the brain operates and which things can go wrong.

Previously I have worked with Suk Joon Lee in the lab of Bernardo Sabatini on the development and implementation of Fluorescent Lifetime Photometry (FLiP), a method that allows for _in vivo_ measurement of Fluorescent lifetime sensors, such as FLiM-AKAR a sensor that measures protein kinase A (PKA) activity. Using FLiP we found that dopamine modulates PKA in the Nucleus accumbens core, in an asynchronous and cell type specific manner. More specifically, we found that in freely moving mice, dynamic increases in dopamine levels leads to an increase in PKA in D1R neurons and no significant response in D2R neurons, while dips in baseline dopamine levels lead to increases in PKA in D2R neurons, while having no significant response in D1R neurons, see Lee et al. 2021 for more details. Considering the importance of understanding the dopamine system in human behavior, neurological disorders and diseases (e.g addiction, Parkinson's disease and depression), this study highlights the importance of integrating the molecular and behavioral research. 

Currently I am building on work I have done with before and pursuing new avenues of research. I am building a new FLiP method, improving the temporal and lifetime resolution of the version previously mentioned. At the same time, I am incorporating a method which will allow us to measure from multiple places in the striatum simultaneously. I am involved in the creation of new sensors and am working in close cooperation with the Ed Boyden group on new methods to identify of SiRis. Finally, I am investigating the molecular changes of microglia in inflammation in vivo.

## Vision
I believe that practicing science is a great way to improve the world. As scientist we are on the forefront of technology, we create new modes of thought, mentor new generations and steer society based on objective observations. Unfortunately, as humans are not perfect, the scientific community is not perfect too and even in our field there is toxic competition, fraud and exploitation. In my opinion: Competition can be great, but we should not forget that cooperation can be more efficient, while toxic competition leads to negativity for everyone. Fraud should be strongly denounced, as it effects the integrity and reliability of our institution. Scientific personnel should be respected at every level, from bachelor summer students till senior PIs.

I strongly believe in science being a force for good. With the limited influence that a grad student has, I try to be a good mentor for all my students, I pursue to do science in a cooperative and non-competitive way, I try to be a constructive lab member and I aim to make the best use of my time, the resources available to me and the time of my students and collaborators. I support open science for everyone through publishing in open access journals where possible. I support and pursue to be part of an inclusive scientific society.
